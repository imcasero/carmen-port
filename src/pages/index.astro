          My name is Carmen. I'm a <span class="font-bol text-gradient-custom"
            >Graphic designer</span
          > and illustrator who loves to create cute and visual atractive
          things. I like to work hard in order to deliver clean and high quality

          I enjoy reading and swimming to let off steam in my days off. Taking
          photos of everything is my vibe, is there anything better than being
          able to remember beautiful moments just watching some pics?
